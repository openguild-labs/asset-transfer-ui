# Asset Transfer UI
Frontend for [@substrate/asset-transfer-api](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api/blob/main)
## Description
Asset-transfer-api is a library focused on simplifying the construction of asset transfers for Substrate based chains that involves system parachains like Asset Hub (Polkadot and Kusama). It exposes a reduced set of methods which facilitates users to send transfers to other (para) chains or locally.
